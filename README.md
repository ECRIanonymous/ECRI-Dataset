# Scalable Early Childhood Reading Performance Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code associated with the paper **"Scalable Early Childhood Reading Performance Prediction"**. The research focuses on leveraging machine learning models to predict early childhood reading performance, which can empower educators to identify at-risk students and provide early, tailored interventions. The study introduces the **Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) dataset**, a large-scale, longitudinal dataset collected from 44 schools involving 6,916 students and 172 teachers.

## Dataset

### Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) Dataset

The ECRI dataset is a  longitudinal dataset specifically designed for modeling and predicting future reading performance in early childhood education. The dataset includes:

- **Demographic Data**: Includes student-level information such as special education status, gender, and English proficiency.
- **Assessment Data**: Includes various reading assessments, such as Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS), Stanford Achievement Test, and Woodcock Reading Mastery Test.
- **Intervention Data**: Records the intervention provided to students identified as at-risk for reading difficulties, including details on instructional strategies employed under the ECRI framework.
